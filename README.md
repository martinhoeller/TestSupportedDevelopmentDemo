# Test Supported Development Demo

This project is a demo app showcasing the technique described in my blog post [Test Supported Development](https://blog.martinhoeller.net/development/2020/05/26/test-supported-development.html).

## Usage

The project was created with Xcode 11.4 and Swift 5.

Check out `LogoutUseCase.swift` and `LogoutUseCaseTests.swift`. The app itself doesn't do anything.
